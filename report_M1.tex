\section{Introduction}

In the early 1960s, in California, a physicist named Theodore H. Maiman invented the first source of light based on the mecanism of amplification by way of stimulated emission: the Q switched Ruby laser. This would not have been possible without the invention of optical pumping methods by the french physicists Alfred Kastler and Jean Brossel in the early 1950s. Then the laser was born and its most important particularity is to emit light coherently which leads to an electromagnetic wave with a very narrow spectrum.
Then, the spectacular advances in laser source, covering a range of frequencies from micro waves to far ultraviolet have offered new opportunities for exploring the structure and the dynamic of atoms and molecules, controlling their internal and external degrees of freedom, and for generating new types of radiation. 
\par
The possibility to push laser intensity to order of magnitude beyond the atomic field acting on the outer shell electrons - a possibility which relies on the development of short laser pulse - has opened the way to the investigation of multiphoton processes. These processes can reveal a host of aspects different from those accessible to the well established one-photon transitions, with their restricted selection rules.
The most important are the above-threshold ionization and the high-harmonic generation.
\par
During the 1970's, experiments were absolute measurements of the dependance of the ionization yield on the laser intensity.
It was a great advance when in 1979, Agostini \textit{et al} \cite{Agostini_1979} measured the energy of the ionized electrons which are ejected after the illumination of atoms with a laser pulse. This is the now well-known photo-electrons spectrum (PES). It was a surprise when they observed that the electrons could absorb many more photons than the minimum number required to be promoted to the continuum. This process called above-threshold tonization (ATI) revealed new channels of ionization.
The second phenomenon of main interest, the high-harmonic generation is first observed up to very high order by L'huillier \textit{et al} in 1987 \cite{Ferray_1988}. by measuring the electromagnetic spectrum after the illumination of atoms with a laser pulse. It consists in the conversion of the initial laser radiation with fixed frequency to high harmonics of that frequency.
\par
More recently, in 2009, Blagua \textit{et al} \cite{Blaga_2009, Quan_2009} observed low-energy structures (LES) in the photo-electrons spectrum. Then, it was shown \cite{Faisal_2009,Liu_2010,Yan_2010,Liu_2011,Kastner_2012_soft} that the soft recollisions where the electron rescatters with the parent nucleus with a large impact parameter are at the origin of the presence of these peaks at low energy.
\par
During this 3 months internship, I have spent the most of the time implementing a code which computes the so-called above-threshold ionization spectrum (photo-electrons spectrum). The simulation is based on the Monte-Carlo method: we compute classic trajectories of an electron just after the ionization step, its positions and velocities at ionization time resulting from the theory of tunneling ionization. 
Initially, I tried to compute the photo-electrons spectrum and to plot some interesting trajectories as published in the article \cite{Hu_1997}. 
Then, I tried to compute the low-energy structure as published in the article \cite{Kastner_2012_pulse}.
Finally, I replaced the hydrogenoid atom by a chiral molecule and the linear polarization of the laser field by a circular one and I tried to look for a signature of the chirality in the low-energy structure.
In parallel, I read the original papers dealing with the most important processes in strong field ionization such as the high harmonic generation and the above-threshold ionization spectrum with from its cut-off to its low-energy structure.


\section{The ionization induced by a strong field}
Let's us first defined some quantities used in this report. $F$ is the electric field defined as
\begin{equation}
\label{electric_field}
F=F_{0} f(t)\cos{\omega t} \mathbf{e_{z}} + \beta F_{0} f(t)\sin{\omega t} \mathbf{e_{x}}
\end{equation}
where the envelope of the pulse laser f(t) is such that
\begin{equation}
\label{envelope}
 \lim_{t\to\pm\infty} f(t)=0.
\end{equation}
$I_{p}$ is the ionization potential of the atom or molecule considered. $U_{p}$ is the kinetic energy of the free electron in the electric field averaged over one period of the field. It is called \textit{ponderomotive energy} or \textit{quiver energy} and is given by:
\begin{equation}
U_{p}=\left< \frac{1}{2}m \left(\frac{eF}{\omega}\sin{\omega t} \right)^{2} \right>_{T} = m \left( \frac{eF}{2\omega} \right)^{2} \; [SI] \; = \frac{F^{2}}{4\omega^{2}} \; [\text{au}],
\end{equation}  
where $F$ and $\omega$ are the amplitude and the pulsation of the electric field.

It is a common practice in the atomic, molecular, and optical fields to use atomic units defined by $m_{e}=1$, $e=1$ and $\hbar=1$. The energy is also often exprimed in eV or in unit of $U_{p}$. Here are some useful conversions
\begin{align*}
\text{intensity: } 1 \text{ au } & = 3.5094451\times10^{16} \text{ W/cm$^{2}$ }  &\text{energy: } 1 \text{ au }&= 27.211608 \text{ eV} \\
\text{Up: } 1\text{ [eV]} &= 0.09337 \, I \text{ [W/cm$^{2}$] }\lambda^{2}\text{ [m] } &\text{time: } 1 \text{ au }&=24.1888421\times10^{-18} \text{ s} 
\end{align*}

For information, the electric fields used for ionization are essentially laser pulses with pulse durations from nanosecond to femtosecond and wavelenghts from infrared to visible.
The strength of the field called intensity is the flux of the electric energy transmitted through an imaginary surface. It can vary from $10^{12}$ W/cm$^{2}$ to $10^{16}$ W/cm$^{2}$.
 

\subsection{Two ionization regimes: tunneling ionization and multiphoton ionization}
Even with the first laser, the Q switched Ruby, the radiation was intense enough to make observable air breakdown and a bunch of theoretical physicists started to show a strong interest for the ionization phenomenon. In his famous paper, published in 1965, Keldysh showed that during the ionization, two regimes are in competition. In weak fields, electrons are promoted into the continuum by the simultaneous absorption of enough photons \textbf{(see figure)}. This process called multiphoton ionization (MPI) was observed for the first by Voronov and Delone in 1965 \cite{Voronov_1966}. However, when the laser intensity increases, at large distances from the atoms, the Coulomb potential is overwhelmed by the instantaneous laser field, producing a barrier through which an electron can escape via quantum tunnelling (see Fig.~(\ref{tunneling_ionization})). That process called tunnel ionization or quasistatic MPI was not immediately accepted as being valid physically until it was observed for the first time in 1985 by Chin \textit{et al} \cite{Chin_1985}. The transition between this two regimes of ionization is defined by the so-called \textit{adiabatic parameter} $\gamma$ defined by
\begin{equation}
\gamma=\sqrt{\frac{I_{p}}{2U_{p}}} = \sqrt{\omega\frac{\sqrt{2I_{p}}}{F}}.
\end{equation}
The weak field and high-frequency limit ($\gamma \gg 1$) corresponds to the MPI regime whereas the tunneling regime is attributed to the strong field and low-frequency limit ($\gamma \ll 1$). In the tunneling regime, we can give a clear meaning of $\gamma$, it is the product of the tunneling time $\tau_{T}$ and the frequency of the field $\omega$ \cite{Misha_2014}. Therefore, in the tunneling limit, $\tau_{T} \ll \frac{1}{\omega}$, the field oscillates slowly enough to let the electron tunneling through the barrier. 

The tardive observation of the tunnel ionization was due to the impossibility to make pulse laser short enough. Indeed, for a long pulse laser, we can not neglect the MPI contribution which becomes significant during the rising and falling part of the pulse where the laser intensity is weaker and then $\gamma \gg 1$ \cite{Chin_2004}.
\par 
During this internship, I studied ionization processes in the long-wavelengh limit (few $\mu$m). One of the main reasons is that this allow a total classical description of the electron after it tunnels out. The next section introduces the ionization rate in the tunneling regime for a given field value and a given final velocity for the electron.

\subsection{The tunneling regime}
\label{tunneling_regime}

The probability of tunneling ionization of a hydrogen atom in an electrostatic field was first determined by Landau and Lifshitz in 1965 \cite{Landau_1965} and is given by $w(0)=(4/F)\exp(-2/3F)$. In 1966, Perelomov, Popov, Terent\'ev (PPT) largely extended the scope of the formula for an oscillating field, with arbitrary intensity and wavelength and for an arbitray state of the atom \cite{PPT_1966}. Then, in 1986 Ammosov, Delone and Krainov (ADK) derived the quasi-classical tunneling limit of the equation of PPT \cite{ADK_1986}. Finally, in 1991 the ADK formula was extended in order to take into account the distribution of electron velocities after tunneling (see Delone and Krainov \cite{Delone_1991}) in the classical approach. The latter is given by
\begin{equation} 
\label{ADK_distribution}
w(\phi_{i},v_{\perp i})=w(0)w(1), \quad w(0)=\frac{4}{F}\exp(-\frac{2}{3}\frac{[2I_{p}]^{3/2}}{F}), \quad w(1)=\frac{1}{\pi F}\exp(-\frac{\sqrt{2I_{p}}v_{\perp}^{2}}{F}),
\end{equation}
where the index $i$ denotes the quantities at the time of ionization and where $1/\pi F$ derived from the condition of normalization over the perpendicular velocity. 
The velocity parallel to the laser polarisation can be took equal to 0 since it plays no role for the photoelectron spectrum. We insist upon the fact that the above expression is only valable in the tunneling regime.
\par
This ionization rate formula has been used to weight classical trajectories in my simulations (see \ref{computation_pes}). For each trajectory, I picked the initial phase of the electric field $\phi_{i}$ as well as each component of the initial perpendicular velocity $v_{\perp X i}$, $v_{\perp Y i}$ where (X,Y) denotes the polarization plane. Then, I computed the probability for having such initial conditions for both the field and the electron velocity with the above formula.
\par
However, when the field is linearly polarized, the system is cylindrical symmetric by reference to the laser polarization and we would prefer picking only the radial component $v_{\perp i}=\sqrt{v_{\perp X i}^{2} + v_{\perp Y i}^{2}}$ instead of the two components $v_{\perp X i}$ and $v_{\perp Y i}$. Then, we have to take into account the additional Jacobian factor $v_{\perp}$ which appears when we transform cartesian coordinates into cylindrical coordinates,
\begin{equation}
w(\phi_{i},v_{\perp i})=w(0)\bar w(1), \quad w(0)=\frac{4}{F}\exp(-\frac{2}{3}\frac{[2I_{p}]^{3/2}}{F}), \quad \bar w(1)=\frac{v_{\perp}}{\pi F}\exp(-\frac{\sqrt{2I_{p}}v_{\perp}^{2}}{F}).
\end{equation}
In the papers mentionned previously, the ionization rate is obtained by computing the transition amplitude between the ground state and the final state and then, by solving the time-dependent Shr\"odinger equation. In order to do so, we use the so-called Strong Field Approximation \cite{Misha_2014}. This consists in neglecting the Coulomb potential as soon as the electron is promoted in the continuuum. The final state is then simply the wave function of a free electron in an electric field and is called \textit{Volkov} state. One of the motivation for doing a such approximation is that the Volkov wave function has an analytic expression.
\par
Since the early 1990, the strong field physics in the tunneling regime has attracted a considerable attention. An important reason for such a thing, is that $\gamma \ll 1$ which is similar to $U_{p} \gg I_{p}$ is compatible with the quasi-classical limit defined by $U_{p} \gg \omega$. This is the case for mid-infrared laser fields where the wavelength is $\lambda \propto 2\,\micro\text{m}$. Upon this condition, we can consider the electron in the continuum as following classical trajectories. Quantum effects like the spreading of the wave function in phase space are encoded in the factor $w(1)$ in the ionization distibution in expression (\ref{ADK_distribution}). It is quite suprising that such quantum effects which occur during the propagation of the wave function in the vacuum can be conceal in the distribution of initial velocities. The quantum properties are then propagated as the electron accomplished its classical trajectory. 
\par
Besides, in contrast to the MPI, in the tunneling limit the position of the electron in the continuum is really clear.
Indeed, the position of the electron $x_{i}$ when tunneling out of the barrier can be derived following a 1 dimensional and classical model (see Fig.~(\ref{tunneling_ionization})). $x_{i}$ is solution of the equation of energy conservation between the time the electron tunnels in and the time the electron tunnels out when supposing the electron is at rest for both instants.
\begin{equation}
-\frac{1}{| x_{i} |}+x_{i}F_{i}=-I_{p} \Rightarrow Fx^{2}+I_{p}x-1=0 \Rightarrow x_{i\pm}=-\frac{I_{p}}{2F_{i}}\pm\frac{\sqrt{I_{p}^{2}-4F_{i}}}{2F_{i}}
\end{equation} 
where $x_{i+}$ and $x_{i-}$ are repectively the positions of the electron when tunneling in and when tunneling out.

\section{Strong field ionization phenomena}

In the previous section, we explained that the character of the dynamic of strong field atomic ionization depends on the value of the adiabatic parameter $\gamma \propto \sqrt{\frac{\omega}{F}}$. When the latter is weak, that is, in the strong field and low-frequency limit (the tunneling limit), we can describe the ionized electron (or photo-electron) in the continuum classically. Therefore, the position and velocity of the electron interacting with both the Coulomb potential of the parent ion and with a linear polarized laser field along $x$ can be derived from the Newton equation
\begin{equation}
\frac{d \mathbf{v(t)}}{dt}=-\frac{\mathbf{r(t)}}{r(t)^{3}}-F\mathbf{e_{x}}\cos(\omega t) f(t) 
\end{equation}
Let's try a first approach in which we neglect the Coulomb field, following the example of the Strong Field Approximation mentionned previously. We also consider that the electron after tunneling out at the time $t_{i}$ is at rest. Then, its velocity at a time $t>t_{i}$ follows
\begin{align}
\label{velocity_free_motion}
v_{x}(t)&=-\frac{F}{\omega}\left[\sin(\omega t) f(t)-\sin(\omega t_{i}) f(t_{i})\right] \\
v_{\perp}(t)&=0
\end{align}
We immediately noticed that the velocity along the field is the superposition of two contributions. The first is the velocity associated with the oscillatory motion, also called \textit{quiver} motion. The second is the velocity related to the translational motion, also called the drift motion. Because of the condition (\ref{envelope}), the drift velocity is the one that we measure in experiment when the field is switched off. It depends only on the phase value of the field at the time $t_{i}$ when the electron becomes free. This sensitivity of the photo-electron energy to the time of ionization is demonstrated by Gallaguer in 1988 who managed to control $t_{i}$ by varying the ionization potential of the atom. For this purpose, he used Rydberg atoms excited to specific states \cite{Gallagher_1988}.
\par
If we integrate the above formula, we get the position $x$ of the free electron along the field
\begin{equation}
\label{position_free_motion}
x(t)=\frac{F}{\omega}\left[\cos(\omega t)-\cos(\omega t_{i})+\sin(\omega t_{i})\omega(t-t_{i})\right],
\end{equation}
where we neglected the position of the electron just after tunneling as well as the fall of the envelope.
The above equation tells us that the electron has two possibilities: it can either escape or be driven back and recollide with the parent ion. The condition of rescattering with the ionic core at a time $t_{c}$ is the condition of zero displacement between the time of ionization $t_{i}$ and the time of collision $t_{c}$
\begin{equation}
\label{zero_displacement}
x(t_{c})=0 
\end{equation}
The resolution of this equation shows that the electron rescatters only for ionization after the maximum of the peak, that is, for $\omega t_{i} \in [0^{\circ},90^{\circ}]$. Otherwise, for $\omega t_{i} \in [-90^{\circ},0^{\circ}]$ the electron never comes back in the vicinity of the nucleus. The difference between these two cases is pure effects of the drift component of the velocity $v_{drift}=\frac{F}{\omega}\sin{\omega t_{i}}$. After the peak  of the field $v_{drift}$ is positive and drives the electron back but before the peak $v_{drift}$ is negative and pushes the electron away. \\
Furthermore, the electron can rescatter several times. The numerical resolution of the zero displacement condition (\ref{zero_displacement}) shows that the electron comes back exactly one time for $\omega t_{i} \in [12.55^{\circ},90^{\circ}]$, 3 times for $\omega t_{i} \in [7.37^{\circ},12.55^{\circ}]$, 5 times for $\omega t_{i} \in [5.24^{\circ},7.37^{\circ}]$ and so on. Asymptotically, the electron comes back an infinite numbers of times when $\omega t_{i}$ tends to the peaks of the field. The Fig.~(\ref{successive_recollision}) shows the graphical resolution of Eq.~(\ref{zero_displacement}) in the case of one and three recollisions.
\begin{figure}

 \caption{Successive recollisions of the electron with the parent ion in the classical model. On the left figure, $\omega t_{i}$ is contained in $[12.55^{\circ},90^{\circ}]$ and the electron recollides only one time. On the right figure, $\omega t_{i}$ is contained in $[7.37^{\circ},12.55^{\circ}]$ and the electron recollides exactly three times.}
 \label{successive_recollision} 
\end{figure}
\par 
When the electron rescatters, it has few possibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item
first, it can recombine with the parent ion and use its kinetic energy for emitting light, it is the so-called high harmonic generation (HHG),
\item
second, it can rescatter inelastically and use its kinetic energy for ionizing a second electron, it is the so-called sequential ionization,
\item
finally, it can rescatter "elastically" (we will understand the quotation marks later), this leads to the so-called above-threshold ionization (ATI).
\end{itemize}
The classical picture of ionization we just discussed is also known as the \textit{three-step model}:
the strong field removes the electron, accelerates it and drives it back to recollide with the ionic core.
In the next part, we will discuss how this naive description can predict the basic features of the high harmonic and above-threshold spectrum.

\subsection{High Harmonic Generation}
\subsubsection{Introduction}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\textwidth}
\vspace{-70pt} 
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{data/lhuillier_HHG.pdf}

\caption{Measured ultraviolet radiations emitted from a $15$-Torr rare-gas medium composed of Argon irradiated by a $1064$-nm strong field laser of intensity $3\times10^{13}$ W/cm$^{2}$ (see \cite{Li_1989}). In 1989, the cut-off energy is not reached yet ($I_{p}+3U_{p}\sim 110\,[eV]$).}
\label{Lhuillier_HHG} 
\vspace{-20pt} 
\end{wrapfigure}

When we measure the electromagnetic response emitted from a dilute gas exposed to a strong laser field, we observe a serie of peaks separated in energy by the photon frequency of the laser field (see Fig.~(\ref{Lhuillier_HHG})). The shape of the spectrum shows a rapid decline at low energy, followed by a plateau of relatively constant harmonic intensity and then a sharp cut-off at high energy.
In 1992, Krause \textit{et al} \cite{Krause_1992} investigated the evolution of the energy of the maximum observable harmonic with the laser intensity, the wavelengh and the ionization potential of the outershell electron. Thus, they derived the well-known cut-off law
\begin{equation}
\label{cut-off}
E_{max}=I_{p}+3U_{p}.
\end{equation}
In 1993, Corkum \cite{Corkum_1993} showed that $3U_{p}$ corresponds to the maximum kinetic energy of the electron at the time of the recollision with the parent ion. This kinetic energy is gained when the electron accelerates in the laser field by absorbing n photons. Then the energy of the unique photon emitted during the recombination process is an integer multiple $n\omega$ of the laser frequency. This explains why the spectrum of the electromagnetic response is only constituted of harmonic of the strong laser field. This explains also its name: high harmonic spectrum.

\subsubsection{Three-step model}

Let's now use the three-step model described previously in order to explained the cut-off law in Eq.~(\ref{cut-off}).
With the expression of the velocity of the electron in Eq.~(\ref{cut-off}) as well as the condition of zero-displacement in Eq.~(\ref{zero_displacement}), we can deduct the kinetic energy $E_{k}$ of the electron at the time of the recollision $t_{c}$
\begin{equation}
\label{3stepmodel_HHG}
E_{k}(t_{c})=2U_{p}\left[ \sin{\omega t_{c}}-\sin{\omega t_{i}}\right ]^{2},
\end{equation}
where we neglected the falling contribution of the envelope ($f(t)=f(t_{i})=1$). \\
We explained previously that for a given phase of ionization $\omega t_{i}$, the electron can rescatter with the ion. 
The left side of Fig.~(\ref{kinetic_energy}) shows the kinetic energy $E_{k}$ in Eq.~(\ref{3stepmodel_HHG}) at the time of the first recollision plotted as a function of the phase of ionization $\omega t_{i}$. The maximum value of $E_{k}$ is $3.17U_{p}$ and the cut-off law in Eq.~(\ref{cut-off}) is clarified. It is attained for $\omega t_{i}=18.0^{\circ}$ and $\omega t_{c}=252.0^{\circ}$. \\

 \label{kinetic_energy} 
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Attosecond pulse generation by HHG}
HHG has attracted a considerable attention in connection to the possibility to generate attosecond pulses (see \cite{Ivanov_2009}).
Then it becomes possible to study processes that occur on time scales approaching the atomic unit of time ($\sim 24\,as$), like the electrons dynamic in atoms and molecules. 
Attosecond pulses can be used in pump-probe scenario, where the first pump laser pulse prepares the system by initiating the dynamic of interest. Then the second laser pulse investigates the evolved dynamic. By varying the time delay between the two pulses, we can make a time-delayed imaging of the evolution of the system.


\subsection{Above-Threshold Ionization}
\subsubsection{Introduction}

When we measure the kinetic energy of the photo-electrons ejected from a dilute gas illuminated by a strong laser field, we obtained a serie of peaks separated in energy by the photon energy of the laser field (see Fig.~(\ref{paulus_ATI})). The spectrum exhibits an abrupt decreasing slope followed by a plateau and again an abrupt decreasing slope.
When we enter in the low-frequency tunneling regime, the distance $\omega$ between each peak is too small for them to be resolvable in experiment, this is the classical limit (see Fig.~(\ref{walker_ATI}). In that case, it is shown \cite{Walker_1996} that the photo-electrons spectra scale with $U_{p}$: the sharp decrease occurs within $[0, 2U_{p}]$, the plateau within $[2U_{p}, 8U_{p}]$ and the cut-off within $[8U_{p}, 10U_{p}]$.

\par
The shape of the photo-electrons spectrum is similar to the shape of the high harmonic spectrum introduced previously, obtained by mesuring the electromagnetic response. However, the energy of the cut-off which were $3U_{p}$ in the harmonic spectrum, extends further \cite{Schafer_1993}, up to $10U_{p}$. This amazed the physicist in the early 1990 because this means that the electron absorbs many more photons that the minimum required for being promoted in the continuum and that a new channel of photon absorption is opened. It was well-known that a bounded electron could absorb photons but it was not easy to accept that even an electron in the continuum could absorb photons. That is why the photo-electron spectrum was called the above-threshold ionization spectrum (ATI spectrum).
\par
The low energy region of the spectrum, up to $2U_{p}$, is simply the energy due to the drift component. Indeed, with the expression (\ref{velocity_free_motion}) of the velocity of the electron as well as the condition (\ref{envelope}), we can derive the expression of the kinetic energy detected when the laser field is switched off
\begin{equation}
E_{k}^{\infty}=2U_{p}\sin(\omega t_{i})f(t_{i}) \quad < \quad 2U_{p}
\end{equation}
The sharp decrease at low energy can be explained by the fact that due to the tunneling rate (factor $w(0)$ in expression (\ref{ADK_distribution})), they are more electrons ionized when the electric field is at its maximum, and this corresponds to a minimum of $\sin(\omega t_{i})f(t_{i})$ in the above expression. Then, the probability is highest when the drift energy of the electron is zero.
\par
However, the high energy region is intriging because it is well-known that a free electron can not absorb photons. In Appendix~\ref{free_electron}, we show that this results from the conservation of the energy and momentum and this is applicable for all massive particle.
This can also be understood classically: in an electric field, the acceleration of the electron will exacty be balanced by the decceleration counterpart when the field will change its direction.
\par
Finally, the only component which remains after the pulse is the initial offset, constant over time, which is responsible for the translational motion. We have to search for a mecanism which increase this drift energy up to $10 U_{p}$.
In experiment, when the laser pulse is long enough, the photo-electron can leave the focus of the laser beam before the latter is swithed off. Therefore the electron will pass through region of space where the electric field is inhomogeneous and will undergoe a force which drives the electron in the region of weak field. Indeed, the electric field at one turning point of the harmonic motion can exceed the electric field at the other one. Finally, the drift velocity in the opposite direction of the gradient of the field is increased. However, this mecanism disappears for ultrashort laser pulse and then, it can not explained the high energy region of the ATI spectrum.
\par
In fact we can not build a predictive model for the ATI spectrum if we consider the electron as completely free and if we neglect the interaction of the electron with the Coulomb potential of the parent ion. Half a cycle after the ionization, the electric field which has changed its direction, drives the electron back in the velocity of the ion. Therefore, the coulomb attraction becomes sufficiently intense to dephased the harmonic motion. Then, a transfer of energy between the oscillatory motion and the drift motion occurs. When coupled with the Coulomb field, the electric field behaves like a reservoir of energy for the electron. This underlying mecanism which explained the multiphoton ionization far from the threshold has been intuited by Kuchiev in 1987 \cite{Kuchiev_1987} when he explained that "the electron in this process plays the role of an absorber of field energy, the role of antenna". 
\par
But the absorption of many photons during electron-ion collisions were already well-known by plasma physicist as free-free transitions or inverse bremstrahlung. They were considered as the mecanism responsible for the electron avalanche in laser-induced air breakdown \cite{Chin_2004}.

\subsubsection{Three-step model}
\label{3stepmodel_ATI}

As for the harmonic spectrum, the position of the cut-off in the ATI spectrum can be predicted with a classical three-step model. This was predated in 1994 by Paulus \textit{et al} \cite{Paulus_1994_Classical_Model}. We suppose a field linearly polarized (along x) such that the trajectory of the electron evolves in a plane (xy). The velocity of the electron just before the recollision is the expression (\ref{velocity_free_motion}) evaluated at the time $t_{c}-\epsilon$ where the time of recollision $t_{c}$ is defined by the condition of zero displacement in Eq.~(\ref{zero_displacement}) and where we neglect the falling contribution of the envelope of the pulse
\begin{align}
v_{x}(t_{c}-\epsilon)&=-\frac{F}{\omega} \left( \sin{\omega t_{c}} - \sin{\omega t_{i}} \right) \\
v_{y}(t_{c}-\epsilon)&=0
\end{align}
After the collision, the norm of the velocity vector is conserved but the electron is deflected with an angle $\theta$, then the velocity just after the scattering is given by
\begin{align}
v_{x}(t_{c}+\epsilon)&=-\frac{F}{\omega} \left( \sin{\omega t_{c}} - \sin{\omega t_{i}} \right) \cos{\theta} \\
v_{y}(t_{c}+\epsilon)&=-\frac{F}{\omega} \left( \sin{\omega t_{c}} - \sin{\omega t_{i}} \right) \sin{\theta}
\end{align}
This constitutes new initial conditions for the classical trajectory of the free electron in the electric field after the scattering process. Thus, its velocity after $t_{c}$ is now
\begin{align}
\label{vx_theta}
v_{x}(t)&=-\frac{F}{\omega} \left(f(t)\sin{\omega t}-\sin{\omega t_{c}} \right) - \frac{F}{\omega} \left( \sin{\omega t_{c}}-\sin{\omega t_{i}} \right) \cos{\theta} \\
\label{vy_theta}
v_{y}(t)&=-\frac{F}{\omega} \left( \sin{\omega t_{c}} - \sin{\omega t_{i}} \right) \sin{\theta}
\end{align}
Therefore, we can deduct the detected kinetic energy of the electron which after having been ionized at the phase $\omega t_{i}$ recollides exactly one time with the parent ion with a deflected angle $\theta$
\begin{equation}
E_{k}^{\infty}=2 U_{p} \left(\sin^{2}{\omega t_{i}}+2(1-\cos{\theta})\sin{\omega t_{c}} \left(\sin{\omega t_{c}}-\sin{\omega t_{i}}\right)\right)
\label{kinetic_energy_theta}
\end{equation}
We immediately see that $E_{k}^{\infty}$ is maximum when $\theta=\pi$, that is, when the photo-electron is scattered backward. Indeed, the back-scattering corresponds to the maximum change in velocity (the velocity vector direction is reversed) and then, it corresponds to the maximum dephasing of the harmonic motion. The detected kinetic energy in Eq.~(\ref{kinetic_energy_theta}) with $\theta=\pi$ is plotted on the right side of the Fig.~(\ref{kinetic_energy}) as a function of the phase of the electric field at which the electron is freed $\omega t_{i}$.
The maximum value is obtained numerically for $10.00 U_{p}$ and confirmed the position of the cut-off observed in experiment. It is attained for $\omega t_{i}=15.0^{\circ}$ and $\omega t_{c}=261.5^{\circ}$.

In right panel, (d) reveals the so-called side lobe which appears for $4U_{p}$. The laser field is monochromatic with frequency $\omega=0.04242$ and intensity $I=1.2\times10^{14}$ W/cm$^{2}$. This corresponds to $\gamma=0.71$ (tunneling regime) and $\hbar\omega/2U_{p}=0.042$ (quasiclassical limit).}
\end{figure}

In the first place, I implemented a code as described in Appendix~\ref{code} in order to compute the photo-electrons spectrum (PES) and the angle-resolved photo-electron spectrum (PAD) in the tunneling limit as published in the article \cite{Hu_1997}. Into this paper, the electric field is linearly polarized and monochromatic as in Eq.~(\ref{electric_field}) with $f(t)=0$ and $\beta=0$. Then, we can not wait for the moment the field is turned off for computing the kinetic energy. However, we can remove the oscillatory motion by doing the substitution $\mathbf{v}\Rightarrow\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{A}$ in Eq.~(\ref{asymptotic_kinetic_energy}) where $\mathbf{A}$ is the vector potential given by $\mathbf{A}=\tfrac{F}{\omega}\sin{\omega t}\mathbf{e_{z}}$. Then, we obtain the compensated kinetic energy
\begin{equation}
E_{k}^{\infty}=\frac{(\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{A})^{2}}{2}-\frac{1}{r}
\end{equation}
which is approximately constant when $\frac{1}{r}$ is weak. Indeed, $\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{A}$ corresponds to the canonical momentum which is an invariant of the motion for a particle in an electromagnetic field. Therefore, the quantity defined above is the kinetic energy after we switched off the field adiabatically.
\par 
The calculated PES is shown in Fig.~(\ref{myATI}). We can clearly distinct the three regions characteristic of the spectrum: the sharp decrease within $[0, 2U_{p}]$, the plateau within $[2U_{p}, 8U_{p}]$ and the abrupt cut-off within $[8U_{p}, 10U_{p}]$. The low-energy component $[0, 2U_{p}]$ is due to the photo-electrons detected directly after ionization with the unchanged drift energy. The plateau is due to the electrons which have absorb photons in the continuum in the combined Coulomb and laser fields (above-threshold ionization). In order to do so, the electrons have to rescatter with the parent ion with a low impact parameter (backward scattering). In such cases, the electrons motion is chaotic and shows a sensitive dependence on the initial conditions \cite{Hu_1997}. We notice that the plateau is several orders of magnitude below the maximum of the spectrum. Indeed, because of the spreading of the electron wave packet which is embedded in the velocities distribution factor $\omega(1)$ in Eq.~\ref{ADK_distribution}, the most of the time the electron misses the ion. Then, hard-scattering responsible for the plateau of ATI are rare events.
\par
The calculated PAD is shown in Fig.~(\ref{myPAD}). The PAD of the low-energy electrons $[O, 2U_{p}]$, in panel (a), is strongly peaked along the field, in the forward direction. Most of the time, these electrons misse the ion and their harmonic motion are not really disturbed by the Coulomb potential. Besides, if the Coulomb potential affects the trajectory, it focuses the electrons along the field direction even more (see Sec.~\ref{soft_rescattering_section}). These electrons are mainly detected in the forward direction because of the initial change in their parallel momemtum they undergoe, due to the Coulomb potential as they are still close to the core. \\
The PAD of the very high-energy electrons, within $[8U_{p}, 10U_{p}]$ in panel (c), is also strongly peaked along the field but in the backward direction. This reveals that the most energetic electrons, detected near the cut-off of the ATI spectrum, undergoes very large-angles scattering (around $180^{\circ}$). This agrees with the results obtained with the 3 step classical model in Sec.~\ref{3stepmodel_ATI}.  \\
By contrast, the PAD in the transition region of the ATI spectrum, shows in panel (b), reveals a much broader distribution. This is due to purely classical kinematic effect and can be explained with the previous 3 step model. Indeed, Eq.~\ref{kinetic_energy_theta} allows a one to one correspondance between the detected kinetic energy and the emission angle $\Omega$ according the field polarization direction defined as
\begin{equation}
\tan{\Omega}=\frac{v_{y}}{v_{x}}
\end{equation}
where $v_{y}$ and $v_{x}$ are defined in Eq.~\ref{vy_theta} and Eq.~\ref{vx_theta}.
For instance, if we look for electrons with an energy restricted to $4U_{p}$, we will only detect electrons with the angle $\Omega=30-40^{\circ}$ as it is shown in panel (d). Then, the resulting PAD for the whole plateau shows in panel (b) is the superposition of all these side lobes.


\subsection{Low-Energy Structure}

We can notice that it exactly coincides with the time intervals such that the electron undergoes big change in $p_{\perp}$. The star $*$ indicates the turning point mentionned in the text. Units are atomic units.}
 \label{soft_recollision}
\end{figure}

When we dealt with the ATI spectrum previously, we explained that although the hard recollisions had to be considered in order to explained the high-energy component of the spectrum, the low-energy part can be explained without having to consider any further electron-ion interaction (strong-field approximation). The reason is that the electrons detected in the region $[0,2U_{p}]$ reached the detector directly after their ionization, with the unchanged initial drift velocity.
However, in 2009 Blaga \textit{et al} \cite{Blaga_2009} and Quan \textit{et al} \cite{Quan_2009} reported the observation of unexpected peaks in the low-energy region of the ATI spectrum for electrons emitted along the polarization direction of strong midinfrared laser field. This was a surprise because it could not be explained in the strong-field approximation. This phenomena has been termed as energy bunching \cite{Kastner_2012_soft}. It reveals it must exist caustic trajectories \cite{Yan_2010}, that is, trajectories which even though they have different initial conditions ($\phi_{i}$ and $\mathbf{p_{i}}$), are focused on the same region in phase space and lead to the same final momentum $\mathbf{p_{f}}$. Analytically, if we consider the map 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{p_{f}}(\phi_{i},\mathbf{p_{i}}): \, (\phi_{i},\mathbf{p_{i}}) \mapsto \mathbf{p_{f}},
\end{equation}
the peaks in the LES correspond to saddle points in $\mathbf{p_{f}}(\phi_{i},\mathbf{p_{i}})$ \cite{Kastner_2012_soft}.
Then, it must exist a mechanism which makes electrons with slightly different initial ionisation phases and slightly different initial momenta acquire a change in their momenta which will compensate their difference and leads to the same final momentum.
\par
In their original article \cite{Blaga_2009}, Blaga \textit{et al} observed that the LES disappears when passing from linear polarized field to circular polarized field. This reveals that recollisons with the ion should be responsible for the LES.
The fact that the peaks appear only for electrons detected along the polarization of the laser field led to suggest that the recollisions accountable for the low-energy features must be forward-scattering \cite{Faisal_2009}, that is, soft recollisions with large impact parameter in contrast to the high-energy large-angle recollisions responsible for the high-energy part of the ATI. 
\par 
Then, in 2010 the origin of the LES was attributed to the mechanism of Coulomb focusing \cite{Liu_2010}. This mechanism, first introduced in \cite{Misha_1996} describes how the multiple rescattering with large impact parameters vanished the transverse component of the momentum $p_{\perp}$ and focuses the electron toward the laser polarization. This explained for instance why most of the electrons detected in the region $[0,2U_{p}]$ are strongly aligned along the laser polarization \cite{Walker_1996}.
In \cite{Liu_2010}, it is showed that for certain conditions on the initial ionization phase $\phi_{i}$, soft recollisions can involve big change in the transverse momentum (according the laser polarization) $p_{\perp}$. If we consider cylindrical coordinate ($\rho$, $\theta$, $z$) along the polarization of the field, they explained that the maximum change in $p_{\perp}$ occurs when the turning point of the harmonic motion is in the plane $z=0$. Such a trajectory is plot in Fig.~(\ref{soft_recollision}). We can clearly see that $p_{\perp}$ varies essentially when the electron z-coordinate is within $40\,au$ (green area). Therefore, we understand that the longer the electron stay in the green area, the greater will be the change in $p_{\perp}$. This occurs when the turning point of the harmonic motion (indicated with a star $*$) is within the green area. It is also established in \cite{Liu_2010} that higher order scattering ($2^{nd}$, $3^{rd}$ and $4^{th}$ recollisons) also strongly contributes to the change in $p_{\perp}$. In \cite{Kastner_2012_soft}, it is shown that these successive soft recollisions with the ion are the mechanism responsible for inducing the required change in the transverse momentum $p_{\perp}$ which compensates the difference in initial momentum $\mathbf{p_{i}}$ and leads to the energy bunching.

\end{figure}

In order to check that there is not any errors in the code described in Appendix~\ref{code}, I try to reproduce the low-energy structure computed by \cite{Kastner_2012_pulse} with a very short laser pulse (Full width at half maximum equals to $2$ optical cycles). I choose the exact same parameters that in the paper. The comparison between the two LES, shown in Fig.(\ref{comparison_Kastner_LES}), reveals really good agreements. This is encouraging and gives us confidence for the further computations.
\par
The field responsible for the spectra is plotted on Fig.~\ref{laser_pulse}. We only picked trajectories which are born near the two subsequent peaks of the field marked with green shades. Then, the four arrows indicate the four possible sets of caustic trajectories responsible for the four peaks of energy bunching in Fig.~\ref{comparison_Kastner_LES}. In the previous section, we explained that these particular trajectories are such that the position of their turning point is in the plane $z=0$ (see Fig.~\ref{soft_recollision}). The two first peaks (red 1 and blue 1 in Fig.~\ref{myLES}) stem from the trajectories which undergoe first-order soft recollisions \cite{Kastner_2012_pulse} as it is the case of the trajectory plotted in Fig.~\ref{soft_recollision}. Indeed, the latter trajectory has been numerically selected as being one of the trajectory responsible for the first red peak. 
The two last peaks (red 2 and blue 2 in Fig.~\ref{myLES}) result from the trajectories which undergoe second-order soft recollisions. In such cases, the soft rescattering event occurs one optical cycle latter compared to the previous ones.

\section{Numerical computation of the photo-electrons spectrum: introduction of the code}
\label{code}

As mentionned earlier, the final objective of the internship is to be able to compute numerically the low-energy part of the photo-electrons spectrum ejected from a medium composed of chiral molecules irradiated by short laser pulses circularly polarized. The purpose of it is to look if there is a signature of the chirality in the low energy part of the spectrum. Before this, I tried to compute the photo-electrons spectrum (PES), the angular-resolved photo-electrons spectrum (PAD) and the low-energy structure (LES). 
\par
The simulation is based on the Monte-Carlo method and is inspired by the quasi-classical method described in \cite{Hu_1997}, it computes the classic trajectories of an electron just after its ionization, the initial positions and velocities resulting from the theory of tunneling ionization introduced in section~\ref{tunneling_regime}.  I chose to implement the code in C++ and I use as far as possible the object-oriented programming. Thus, the code is made of the following 10 classes.
\begin{itemize}
\item
IC: set the initial conditions ($\phi_{i}$, $x_{i}$, $\mathbf{v_{\perp i}}$) required for the classical trajectory and the related probability for tunneling at the phase $\phi_{i}$ with the velocity $v_{\perp i}$.
\item
Solve: integrates the Newtonian system of ordinary differential equations of motion using the Runge-Kutta algorithm (of order 5) with adaptive step-size methods.
\item
System: contains the Newtonian system of ordinary differential equations of motion.
\item
ElectricField: contains the informations about the electric field (amplitude, wavelenght, pulse duration, components on x,y,z, vector potential...).
\item
ElectrostaticPotential: contains the informations about the potential of the atom/molecule (ionization potential, charges, bond lenghts, potential value...). It is an abstract class which is extended by the two derived classes Hydrogen and Molecule which specify the potential properties for an hydrogen-like atom and a molecule. 
\item
Spectra: stores the kinetic energy of the electrons as well as the related tunneling rate (trajectory weight) after each trajectory. Then, it computes the photo-electrons spectrum. In order to do so, as for an histogram, we divide the entire range of values for the kinetic energy into a series of small intervals and then, we count how many events considered with their weight fall into each interval.
\item
Plot: plots the spectrum with Gnuplot.
\item
Display: displays informations on the terminal. 
\end{itemize}
\par
Of course there is also the main program which calls the different methods defined in each class step by step: \\
First, the three initial parameters which define one trajectory ($\phi_{i}$, $v_{\perp X i}$, $v_{\perp Y i}$) are uniformly distributed on a 3D grid through three loops. Each trajectory is weighted by the instantaneous tunneling ionization rate $w (0)$ and the initial transverse velocities distribution $w (1)$ (or $\bar w(1)$ in the case of a linear laser field) in expression (\ref{ADK_distribution}). Since most of the trajectories barely contribute because of their tiny weight, we discard the ones such that the related ionization probability is less than a given threshold.
Second, each trajectory is propagated until the electron is far enough from the ionic core or until the field if switched off (only valid for a finite pulse). 
Third, if the electron is not bounded, we compute its asymptotic kinetic energy and stores it, as well as the related ionization probability.
When all the values ($\phi_{i}$, $v_{\perp X i}$, $v_{\perp Y i}$) on the 3D grid have been sampled, we plot the spectrum.
\par 
We precise that the asymptotic kinetic energy is the kinetic energy when the electron is at a infinite distance from the ionic core, so that
\begin{equation}
\label{asymptotic_kinetic_energy}
E_{k}^{\infty}=\frac{\mathbf{v}^{2}}{2}-\frac{1}{r}.
\end{equation}

\section{A free electron can't absorb photon}
\label{free_electron}

In special relativity, the conservation of the energy and momentum does not allow a free electron to absorb photon.
Let's consider a collision between an free electron with momentum $\mathbf{p_{i}}$ and a photon with momentum $\mathbf{k_{i}}$ followed by the absorption of the photon by the electron. We denote $\mathbf{p_{f}}$ the final momentum of the electron. The energy-momentum four-vector of the system \{electron$+$photon\} is given by
\begin{equation}
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
E_{tot}\\
\mathbf{p_{tot}}\\
\end{array}
\right)
=
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
E_{e}^{i}\\
\mathbf{p_{i}}\\
\end{array}
\right)_{e^{-}}
+\left(
\begin{array}{c}
E_{\gamma}\\
\mathbf{k_{i}}\\
\end{array}
\right)_{\gamma}
\end{equation}
where $E_{e}=\sqrt{(pc)^{2}+(mc^{2})^{2}}$ and $E_{\gamma}=\hbar kc$.
The conservation of the energy and momentum is given by
\begin{align}
\label{momentum_conservation}
\mathbf{p_{f}}&=\mathbf{p_{i}}+\hbar \mathbf{k_{i}}, \\
\label{energy_conservation}
E_{e}^{f}&=E_{e}^{i}+E_{\gamma}.
\end{align}
Then, if we note $\theta$ the angle between $\mathbf{p_{i}}$ and $\mathbf{k_{i}}$, we obtain
\begin{align}
E_{e}^{f2}&=E_{e}^{i2}+E_{\gamma}^{2}+2\sqrt{E_{e}^{i2}-(mc^{2})^{2}}E_{\gamma}\cos{\theta}, \\
E_{e}^{f2}&=E_{e}^{i2}+E_{\gamma}^{2}+2 E_{e}^{i}E_{\gamma}.
\end{align}
If we now take the difference between these two equations, we get
\begin{equation}
E_{e}^{i}=\sqrt{E_{e}^{i2}-(mc^{2})^{2}}\cos{\theta} \quad \Rightarrow \quad E_{e}^{i2} \tan^{2}{\theta} = -(mc^{2})^{2}
\end{equation}
which can not be satisfied for a particule of finite mass $m\neq0$ like it is of course the case of the electron. Thus, we just demonstrated that a free electron can not absorb photons\footnote{However, for really strong field such that $U_{p}$ is becoming comparable with the electron's rest energy $mc^{2}$, we enter in the relativistic regime and we can not neglect the Lorentz magnetic force anymore. The latter opens a new channel of multi-photons absorption.}.
