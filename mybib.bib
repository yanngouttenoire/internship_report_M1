  abstract={Soft recollisions are laser-driven distant collisions of an electron with its parent ion. Such collisions may cause an energy bunching, since electrons with different initial drift momenta can acquire impulses which exactly counterbalance these differences. The bunching generates a series of peaks in the photo-electron spectrum. We will show that this series could be uncovered peak by peak experimentally by means of phase-stabilized few-cycle pulses with increasing duration.}

  abstract={The contribution of multiple forward scattering in Coulomb focusing of low-energy photoelectrons at above-threshold ionization in mid-infrared laser fields is investigated. It is shown that the high-order forward scattering can have a nonperturbative effect in Coulomb focusing. The effective number of rescattering events is defined and is shown to depend weakly on laser intensity and wavelength. Nevertheless, the relative contribution of forward scattering in Coulomb focusing and the Coulomb focusing in total decrease with increasing laser intensity and wavelength.}

The measurements have been performed in order to investigate the connection between two recently discovered effects in above-threshold ionization, namely a plateau in the photoelectron spectra and side lobes in the corresponding angular distributions. The side lobes are found to be restricted to the region where the plateau begins. This affords a new explanation of the origin of the side lobes.}

Harmonic light as high as the 33rd harmonic in the XUV range (32.2 nm) is generated in argon. The key point is that the harmonic intensity falls slowly beyond the fifth harmonic as the order increases. Finally, a UV continuum, beginning at 350 nm and extending down towards the short wavelength region is apparent in xenon.}

In addition the method displays the time evolution of excitation and ionisation processes and shows that the latter may proceed through a great variety of intermediate excitation processes. The mechanism is discussed. The probability of ionisation at time t is given by P ion (t)=(1-Q T )(1-exp(- beta (t)t)) where Q T is the probability of orbits which lie in invariant tori. Quantal effects are not significant for comparison with the Bayfield and Koch experiment, but they are discussed in connection with the implications of the results for multiphoton laser ionisation of low n states.}
